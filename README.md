# AI Image Captioning

We use a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network to generate embeddings for the images in our dataset.
The embeddings are then used to train an LSTM Network in order to generate captions in natural language for our images.

You can find the paper [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555).
